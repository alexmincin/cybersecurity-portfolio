## About this Lab
- The main focus of this lab was to introduce me to the idea of offensive security, and give me a basic idea of what it is. 
- During this lab we utilized the tool "dirb" which used a brute-force approach. I utilized "dirb" by entering "dirb http://fakebank.thm" into terminal which then led the the output of a wordlist file, and successful URLs that work from the wordlist.
- The URL "http://fakebank.thm/bank-deposit" was found, and with the URL we are able to access the admin portal and deposit funds into our account.
