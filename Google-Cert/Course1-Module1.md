- **Cybersecurity:** The practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.
- **Threat Actor:** Any person or group who presents a security risk.
- **Compliance:** The process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.
- **Security Framework:** Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
- **Security Controls:** Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.
- **Security Posture:** An organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.
- **Internal Threat:** Can be current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk.

- **Transferable Skills:** Skills from other areas that can apply to different careers.
- **Technical Skills:** Skills that require knowledge of specific tools, procedures, and policies.

## Reflection
This module introduced me to all the possible paths I can head down in cybersecurity. It taught me the importance of cybersecurity and the brief responsibilities of each role. I learned several important terms, and can now distinguish the difference between transferable skills and technical skills, and the difference between Personally Identifiable Information and Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information.
