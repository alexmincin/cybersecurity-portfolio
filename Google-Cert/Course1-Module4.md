## Key Concepts & Terms
- **Log:** A record of events that occur within an organization's systems.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tool:** An application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization.
- **Playbook:** A manual that provides details about any operational action.
- **Network Protocol Analyzer (Packet Sniffer):** A tool desgned to capture and analyze data traffic within a network.
- **Programming:** Used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks.
- **Linux:** Open-surce operating system.
- **Database:** An organized collection of information or data.
- **Structured Query Language (SQL):** A programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database.
- **Python:** Used to perform tasks that are repetitive and time consuming, and that require a high level of detail and accuracy.
- **Automation:** The use of technology to reduce human and manual effort in performing common and repetitive tasks.
- **Data Point:** A specific piece of information.
- **Command:** An instruction telling the computer to do something.
- **Command Line:** A text-based user interface that uses commands to interact with the computer.
- **Web Vulnerability:** A unique flaw in a web applicatiomn that a threat actor could exploit by using malicious code or behavior, to allow unauthorized access, data theft, and malware deployment.
- **Antivirus Software:** A software program used to prevent, detect, and eliminate malware and viruses.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** An application that monitors system activity and alerts a possible intrusion.
- **Encryption:** The process of converting data from a readable format to a cryptographically encoded format.
- **Cryptographically Encoding:** Converting plaintext into secure ciphertext.
- **Plaintext:** Unencrypted Information
- **Secrure Ciphertext:** The result of encryption
- **Order of Volatility:** A sequence outlining the order of data that must be preserved from first to last.
- **Protecting and Preserving Evidence:** The process of properly working with fragile and volatile digital evidence.
- **Penetration Testing:** The act of participating in a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes.

## Reflection
This module highlighted the importance of using different tools and programming languages, such as SIEMs, network protocol analyzers, linux operating system, SQL, and python. With an emphasis on how these tools benefit analysts with productivity and how effective they can be. This module also expanded my knowledge on how encryption works, and how important it is.
