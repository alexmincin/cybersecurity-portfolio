# Course: Foundations of Cybersecurity
## Module 2 - The Evolution of Cybersecurity  

---

## Objective
Expand knowledge of the fundamentals of cybersecurity, learn about the history of cybersecurity, the different kinds of attacks, and threat actors and their motivations.  

---

## Key Concepts & Terms
- **Malware:** Software designed to harm devices or networks.  
- **Virus:** Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.  
- **Worm:** Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own.  
- **Ransomware:** A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.  
- **Spyware:** Malware that collects and sells information without consent.  
- **Phishing:** The use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.  
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** A threat actor sends an email that appears to come from a known source to request information or payments.  
- **Spear Phishing:** A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group.  
- **Whaling:** A form of spear phishing that targets company executives.  
- **Vishing:** Using voice communications to obtain sensitive information or impersonate a trusted source.  
- **Smishing:** Using text messages to trick users into giving up sensitive information.  
- **Social Engineering:** Manipulating people to gain private information, access, or valuables.  
- **Social Media Phishing:** A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites.  
- **Watering Hole Attack:** A threat actor infects a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.  
- **USB Baiting:** Leaving a malware-infected USB drive for someone to plug in, unknowingly infecting the system.  
- **Physical Social Engineering:** A threat actor impersonates someone (employee, customer, vendor) to gain physical access.  
- **Password Attack:** Attempting to crack or obtain passwords for secured systems.  
- **Physical Attack:** A security incident that impacts both digital and physical environments.  
- **Adversarial Artificial Intelligence:** Manipulating AI/ML systems to make attacks more efficient.  
- **Supply Chain Attack:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or vendors to deploy malware.  
- **Cryptographic Attack:** Attacking secure communications to break encryption.  
- **Advanced Persistent Threats (APT):** Sophisticated, long-term attacks on networks by highly skilled threat actors.  
- **Insider Threats:** Authorized individuals who misuse their access to cause harm.  
- **Hacktivists:** Threat actors motivated by political or social causes.  
- **Authorized Hackers (Ethical Hackers):** Hackers who follow laws and ethics to test security.  
- **Semi-Authorized Hackers:** Researchers who identify vulnerabilities but do not exploit them.  
- **Unauthorized Hackers (Unethical Hackers):** Malicious hackers who ignore laws and ethics.

## Cybersecurity History
- **Brain Virus (1986, Alvi Brothers):** Created to track illegal copies of medical software, but spread globally within months, slowing productivity and harming businesses.  
- **Morris Worm (1988, Robert Morris):** Intended to assess the size of the internet, but infected ~6,000 systems (~10% of the internet), costing millions in damages.  
- **ILOVEYOU Malware (2000, Onel De Guzman):** Early social engineering attack spread via email attachments. Infected 45 million computers and caused ~$10 billion in damages.  
- **Equifax Breach (2017):** Compromised over 143 million customer records, exposing PII/SPII of ~40% of Americans. Led to $575 million in settlements and the establishment of CSIRTs.

## Reflection
This module highlighted how cybersecurity has evolved alongside technology. I learned how early attacks like the Brain Virus and Morris Worm shaped todayâ€™s security practices, and how social engineering techniques remain effective because they target human behavior. Understanding the motivations of different threat actors whether financial, political, or insider showed me why defensive strategies must be both technical and people-focused. It also reinforced the importance of frameworks like CISSP domains in creating a structured approach to security.
