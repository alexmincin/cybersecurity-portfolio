# Course: Foundations of Cybersecurity
## Module 3 - Protect against threats, risks, and vulnerabilities

---

## Objective
Learn about how organizations protect themselves from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities by covering key principles such as frameworks, controls, and ethics.

---

## Key Concepts & Terms
- **Security Frameworks:** Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.
- **Security Lifecycle:** A constantly evolving set of policies and standards.
- **Security Controls:** Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.
- **CIA Triad:** A foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when settings up systems and security policies.
- **Confidentiality:** Only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
- **Itegrity:** Data is correct, authentic, and reliable.
- **Availability:** Data is accessible to those who are authorized to accessit.
- **Asset:** An item perceived as having value to an organization.
- **National Institute of STandards and Technology (NIST):** A U.S.-based agency that develops multiple voluntary compliance frameworks that organizations worldwide can use to help mitigate risk.
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):** A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.
- **Security Ethics:** Guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a secruity professional.
- **Security Achitecture:** A type of security design composed of multiple components, such as tools and processes, that are used to protect an organization from risks, and external threats.

## Security Frameworks Four Core Components
- **Goals:** Identifying and documenting secruity goals.
- **Guidelines:** Setting guidelines to achieve secruity goals.
- **Processes:** Implementing strong secruity processes.
- **Communication:** Monitoring and communicating results.

- Center for Internet Security (CIS)
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
- The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA)
- International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
- System and Organizations Controls (SOC Type 1, SOC Type 2)

## Reflection
This module highlighted the importance of security frameworks, security controls, and ethics within the cybersecurity field. I learned the fundamentals of a secruity framework, and many examples of its real world use. Expanded my knowledge on the importance of having strong ethics in cybersecurity and the laws behind privacy protection.
